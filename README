Must have python 2.7 installed to play

To run:

Open a CLI
use command: python scorch.py

To play:

Play is separated by turns
One player shoots at a time, followed by the other player and so on
Each player aims with the mouse and hits SPACEBAR to fire
Aiming goes from the ships centre position to the mouse position
Damage dealt is proportional to the distance travelled by the bullet
Each planets gravity affects the bullet no matter where it is
When one players ships hull strength is zero, the other player wins
